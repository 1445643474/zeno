This tutorial loads two meshes with texture coordinates and cuts them, propagating the texture coordinates to the output fragments.

"a.obj" is the source mesh
"b.obj" is the cut mesh

Simply compile and run

The output will be written into the data/ folder because that is where the textures are located.

You can view the meshes using Meshlab (https://www.meshlab.net/) or any tool that can visualise .obj files that have textures.
