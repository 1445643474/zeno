Welcome to use the binary release of ZENO! To play with it, simply extract the `.tar.gz` and run `./start.sh` in it, the node editor window will shows up if everything works.

There are some example graphs in the `./arts/` folder, you may open them in the editor and have fun!

If you find the binary release didn't worked properly or some error message has been thrown on your machine, please let me know by opening an [issue](https://github.com/zensim-dev/zeno/issues) on the GitHub, thanks for you support!
